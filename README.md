# Percentile_normalization Plugin for imagej
## Percentile Normalization normalizes to a specific percentile e.g. 2% as lower bound and 98% as upper bound. By taking the percentile, outliers are set to the nearest bound value from the normalization. This technique is interesting if the data has outliers and the distribution within the data varies.But choosing the proper bounds is not so intutive.  __This project  provides a real-time visualization of the Image Percentile Normalization result with Boundary parameters that can be adjusted easily.__
